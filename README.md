Hi there 👋 

I'm Abdul Rehman

I specialize in building responsive ai web applications using nextjs and typescript, integrating APIs for dynamic real-time data, and developing secure, high-performance solutions. Additionally, I'm advancing my skills in Node.js to design dynamic, scalable web applications.  

I'm open to contributing to open-source projects! If you’re interested in collaborating on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, or TypeScript projects, let's connect!  

Thank you for visiting my profile! 🚀
